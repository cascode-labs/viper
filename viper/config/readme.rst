Config
======

Handles the configuration of the viper setup.  The viper configuration is saved
in a yaml configuration file, project.yml, saved in the same folder as the user
initialization script.

User Initialization Script
--------------------------
Virt supports bash/sh, tcsh, and xonsh shells.  A initialization script is
included for each. Users just have to source these scripts to in their shell
startup (rc) file(s) to use viper.
