It supports design workflows with both open-source and proprietary software tools. It also natively supports software and generator based circuit design flows in addition to traditional flows. It supports both open source tools and Cadence Virtuoso with the Virtue package. It also supports extensions to easily extend its functionality. Commands viper open <project_name> - Open a project in the project manager gui viper config - Read the viper environment configuration viper project create <project_name> - Create a new Viper project viper welcome - Display a welcome message with the version and documentation URL viper --help - Print a help message viper --docs - Print the URL to the documentation Project Manager Still under development Viper Design Environment EDA environments can be difficult and messy to setup. Viper simplifies this process with declaritive toml configuration files. It also makes tool selection and initialization pythonic by turning them into Python Conda packages and installing them into virtual design environments. Viper-forge Viper-forge is an initiative to develop conda recipes to package EDA tools into conda packages hosted on conda-forge . Contributing All development planning happens in GitHub issues and GitHub discussions . If you see an issue of interest, first check to see if there is an existing branch named after its issue number. Then feel free to comment on the issue and hopefully submit a pull request with your update. For more general questions or if you're looking for guidance on getting started, post in GitHub discussions .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Viper is a hybrid integrated circuit design environment .
